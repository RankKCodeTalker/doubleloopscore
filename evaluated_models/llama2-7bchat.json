        "question": "石琨及张举、王朗率领七万士众攻打邺城，冉闵带领千余骑兵，在城北抵抗他们。冉闵手执两刃矛，飞驰进攻，对手应刃而败，斩杀首级三千。冉闵在城北杀了多少人?",
        "answer": "According to the passage, 冉闵 (Rán Miàn) led a group of 1,000 cavalrymen and defeated 石琨 (Shí Qiān) and his army of 700,000 soldiers. 冉闵 used a double-edged spear and rode a horse to attack the enemy, and the enemy was defeated and killed.\nThe passage does not provide a specific number of people killed by 冉闵, but it does mention that he killed 3,000 enemy soldiers with his spear. Therefore, we can infer that 冉闵 killed at least 3,000 people in the battle."

        "answer": "Money laundering, also known as \"洗钱\" in Chinese, is the process of making illegally obtained money or assets appear to be legitimate and clean. This is typically done by passing the illegal funds through a complex series of financial transactions, such as through shell companies, offshore bank accounts, or other financial instruments, in order to disguise their origins and make them appear to be from legitimate sources.\nThe process of money laundering is often divided into three stages:\n1. Placement: This is the initial stage of money laundering, where the illegal funds are introduced into the financial system. This can be done by depositing the funds into a bank account, purchasing assets, or using other financial instruments.\n2. Layering: In this stage, the illegal funds are moved through a complex web of transactions, such as through shell companies, offshore bank accounts, or other financial instruments, in order to disguise their origins and make them appear to be from legitimate sources. This can involve multiple layers of transactions and accounts, and is designed to make it difficult to trace the funds back to their illegal origins.\n3. Integration:"

        "answer": "Yes, that's correct! When calling a phone number in China from abroad, you need to add the international access code (also known as the international direct dialing code or IDD) before the Chinese phone number. The international access code for China is +86.\nSo, if you want to call a phone number in China, you would dial something like this:\n+86-area code-phone number\nFor example, if you want to call a phone number in Beijing, the area code is 10, so you would dial:\n+86-10-phone number\nIt's important to note that China has a complex phone number format, with different area codes and prefixes for different regions. You can find the area code and prefix for a specific region by searching online or using a phone number lookup tool.\nAlso, keep in mind that calling rates and time differences may apply when calling China from abroad. It's always a good idea to check with your phone service provider for the most up-to-date information on calling rates and times."

The rule of the game is that if a card's letter side is a vowel, then its number side is odd.\nTo determine which cards need to be flipped over to check their validity, we can use the following logic:\n1. E - The letter \"E\" is a vowel, so its number side is odd. Therefore, the card with the letter \"E\" on one side and a number on the other needs to be flipped over to check if it is valid.\n2. K - The letter \"K\" is a consonant, so its number side is even. Since the card with the letter \"K\" on one side and a number on the other does not meet the rule, it is not a valid card.\n3. 4 - The number \"4\" is even, so the card with the number \"4\" on one side and a letter on the other is not a valid card.\n4. 7 - The number \"7\" is odd, so the card with"

The other 9 boxes are empty. You are given the opportunity to choose one of the remaining 9 boxes, and then I randomly open one of the other 9 boxes to show you that it is empty. You then have one chance to choose another box from the remaining 8.\nThe question is, should you take the opportunity to choose a new box, hoping to get a better gift, or stick with the box you originally chose?\nThere are different ways to approach this problem, but a common solution is to use the \"expected value\" of the gifts. In this case, the expected value of the gifts is the average value of the gifts in each box. Since you don't know the exact value of the gift in the box you originally chose, you can't use that information to make a decision.

        "answer": "This is a classic puzzle known as \"The Length of the Candles.\" Here's how you can solve it:\n\nLet's assume that the two candles are of equal thickness at the start, and let's call the length of the shorter candle x. Since the shorter candle burns for 4 hours, it will have burned down to x/4 of its original length.\nSimilarly, the longer candle will have burned down to (7 - x)/4 of its original length.\nNow, when the power comes back on, we know that the shorter candle has burned down to x/4 of its original length, and the longer candle has burned down to (7 - x)/4 of its original length.\nWe can now use the fact that the two candles are of equal thickness at the start to find the original length of the longer candle. Since the longer candle burns for 7 hours, it will have burned down to 7x/4 of its original length.\nSo, the original length of the longer candle is 7x/4.\nNow, we can find the original length of the shorter cand"

Osmosis: Green beans are made up of mostly water, so it's possible that they absorbed water from the surrounding environment through a process called osmosis. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration through a selectively permeable membrane. In this case, the green beans may have absorbed water from the water in the cup, causing them to swell.\n2. Fermentation: Another possibility is that the green beans fermented in the water overnight. Fermentation is a process where microorganisms like bacteria or yeast convert sugars into alcohol or acids. In this case, the green beans may have produced gases or alcohols that caused them to expand.\n3. Temper"

        "question": "“但愿人长久，千里共婵娟”，其中婵娟指的是什么？",
        "answer": "\"婵娟\" (yǎn yuè) in the Chinese idiom \"但愿人长久，千里共婵娟\" (dān yuè rén cháng jiǔ, qiān lǐ gòng yǎn yuè) is a metaphorical expression that refers to a long-distance relationship or a deep bond between two people.\nThe word \"婵娟\" (yǎn yuè) literally means \"to share a bed,\" but in this context, it is used to describe a close and intimate relationship that transcends physical distance. The idiom suggests that even if the two people are separated by a great distance, their bond remains strong and unbreakable, like two people sharing a bed.\nSo, in essence, \"婵娟\" (yǎn yuè) in this idiom represents a deep emotional connection between two people that goes beyond the physical realm."

        "question": "“拱手而立”表示对长者的尊敬，一般来说，男子行拱手礼时应该左手在外还是右手在外？",
        "answer": "In traditional Chinese culture, \"拱手而立\" (bowing with both hands together) is a gesture of respect and deference, typically used when greeting or paying homage to someone of higher social status or age.\nWhen performing this gesture, the left hand is usually placed outside the right hand, with the palms facing upwards. This is because in Chinese culture, the left hand is associated with the concept of \"yin\" (陰), which represents femininity, receptivity, and passivity, while the right hand is associated with the concept of \"yang\" (陽), which represents masculinity, activity, and creativity.\nTherefore, by placing the left hand outside the right hand, the individual is demonstrating a more submissive and respectful stance, acknowledging the other person's superior status or age.\nHowever, it's worth noting that the specific placement of the hands may vary depending on the context and the individual's personal preference. In some cases, the right hand may be placed outside the left hand, or the hands may be placed in a more neutral position, with both palms facing each other. Ultimately, the most important thing"
